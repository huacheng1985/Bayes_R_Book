# Introduction to R {#intro}

## Part 1: Vector

Define variable / vector

### Numbers

```{r}
# Type in a numerical data, assign them to the variable: weight
weight = c(60,72,57,90,95,72)
# Print out the variable
weight
# You can also type in decimals
height = c(1.75,1.80,1.65,1.90,1.74,1.91)
# Or even formulas, assign to the variable.
bmi = weight/(height)^2
bmi
```

### Strings (nominal)

```{r}
# Characters between the quotation marks are consider strings
A = c("NewYork","London","San Francisco")
A
```

### Logical

```{r}
# A logical vector is a vector that only contains TRUE and FALSE values. In R, true values are designated with TRUE, and false values with FALSE.
B=c(T,T,F,F)
B
bmi > 25  # relational expressions
```

### Generate a sequence of numbers 

```{r}
seq(4,9) #sequence from 4 to 9, increment defaults to 1, alternatively, 4:9
seq(4,10,2) #sequence from 4 to 10, increment is 2
seq(1,10,.1) #sequence from 1 to 10, increment is .1
seq(-8,9,.5) #sequence from -8 to 9, increment is .5
```

### Replicate values

```{r}
exp1 <- c(1,2,3,4,5) #create a vector named as exp1
rep(exp1,3) #repeat 3 times 

ha=c(1,2,3,"sun")
rep(ha,4) #repeat "ha" four times
rep(ha,1:4) #each element is repeated different times, according to the second argument
rep(3:4,c(100,200)) #the first element repeat 100 time, the second 200 times
```

### Practice Questions

#### Question 1

Create a sequence (name it with your first name) ranging from 1 to 100, increment is 1

#### Question 2

Repeat the sequence just created 3 times

#### Question 3

Calculate the ratios between the two variables as last/first, and multiply by 2.

## Part 2: Basic Statistical Analysis

### Buiding a simulated data set

```{r}
# We use the following functions to build a simulated data set.
ACT_score <- round(runif(n=100,min=18,max=25),0)
```

### Basic Statistical function

```{r}
# calculate summation
sum(ACT_score) 
# calculate average score
mean(ACT_score)
# calculate median score
median(ACT_score) 
# calculate variance
var(ACT_score) 
# calculate standard deviation
sd(ACT_score) 
# print vector length (sample size)
length(ACT_score) 
# calculate square root of each number
sqrt(ACT_score) 
#--with NA, print order of each number in the vector
order(ACT_score)    
# calculate range of the vector
range(ACT_score) 
#--omit NA, sort date from low to hight
sort(ACT_score)  
#--make a table of counts
table(ACT_score)  

#-- Using the function "describe" from the "psych" package. Please attach the psych package
library(psych)
describe(ACT_score)
```

### Practice Questions

## Part 3: Matrix Computation

### Build a matrix

```{r}
x=1:12 
#set the dimension of the matrix
dim(x)=c(3,4) #three rows and four cols 
x
```

### Define a matrix

```{r}
# Different from the above matrix, we define a matrix use matrix function
matrix(1:12,nrow=3,byrow=T) 
```

### Name the rows/columns

rownames(); colnames()----can be used to a data matrix

```{r}
x=matrix(1:12, nrow=3,byrow=T)
x
rownames(x)=LETTERS[1:3]
colnames(x)=LETTERS[4:7]
x
colnames(x) <- c("gpa","quiz1","quiz2","final")
x
```

### Operation on matrix

```{r}
# The transpose of a matrix is simply a flipped version of the original matrix. We can transpose a matrix by switching its rows with its columns.  
t(x)
#multiply two matrix, if they are conformable
x%*%t(x) #check the dimensions  

t(x)%*%x
```

### Glue vectors together

```{r}
# Using cbind() function to combine columns
cbind(A=1:4,B=5:8,C=9:12)
# Using rbind() function to combine rows
rbind(A=1:4,B=5:8,C=9:12)
```

### Inverse the matrix

The inverse of a square matrix A, sometimes called a reciprocal matrix, is a matrix $A^{-1}$ such that $AA^{-1}=I$ , where $I$ is the identity matrix.

[C] The fractions() need load "MASS" Package.

```{r}
# Load the package "MASS" to use the fractions function
library(MASS)
# Build a square matrix A. 
A <- matrix(c(2,3,2,2), nrow=2,byrow=T)
# Print out
A 
#inverse the matrix       
inv_A <- solve(A,tol=1e-19)

#round              
round(solve(A,tol=1e-19),3) #to the third digits
#show as rationals  
fractions(solve(A,tol=1e-19))

# Ax=b: solve(A,b)
# create an Identity matrix
ident_matrix <- diag(2)
solve(A,diag(2))

```


### Practice Questions

#### Question 1

#### Question 2
Please inverse the matrix "MM", name it as MM-T

#### Question 3

## Part 4: Data Manipulation

### Load the Data

```{r}
# Load the package for illustrations
library(car)
# Load the data set
data(Prestige)
# Check the dimension of the data
dim(Prestige) # 102 observations, each observation has 6 variables.
# Checking the variable names
names(Prestige)
# subset the data
Prestige[1:10,1:3] #selecting the first 10 subjects with first three variables 
Prestige[,1:3] #selecting all subjects with first three variables 
Prestige$education #selecting the variable "education"
Prestige[1:10,c("education","income")] #selecting the first 10 subjects with the variables "education" and "income"
```

### Select Specific Data

```{r}
# put 1's in the first col., others in 2-4th
X=cbind(1,as.matrix(Prestige[,1:3])) 
X
# adding ID
X1=cbind(seq(1:102),as.matrix(Prestige[,1:3])) 
colnames(X1)= c("ID","education", "income", "women")
X1
# select only the 4th column of the dataset: Prestige
y=Prestige[,4] 
y
# select the first five subjects with all columns
X[1:5,] 
#select variables ("education" ,"prestige") and the first five subjects
Prestige[1:5,c("prestige","education")] 
```

### Correlation and Covariate Matrix

```{r}
# Calculate the correlations among three variables
R=cor(cbind(Prestige$education,Prestige$income,Prestige$women))
R # Correlation matrix
plot(Prestige$education,Prestige$income)
# Calculate the covariance among three variables
S =cov(cbind(Prestige$education,Prestige$income,Prestige$women))
S # Covariance matrix
```

### Matrix Diagonals

```{r}
# extract diagonal of R (correlation matrix)
diag(R)    
# set diagonal of R
diag(R)=NA

## Part 5: Factor, List, and Dataframe

### Factors

Categorical variables whose input are numeric: "factors" Terminology: a factor has a set of "levels"

```{r}
## build a continuous variable
pain=c(0,3,2,2,1) 
## set the level of pain as a factor
fpain=factor(pain,levels=0:3) ## categorical has a order: ordinal scale
## rename the factors of our "fpain" variable
levels(fpain)=c("none","mild","medium","sever") 
# Print pain (show as only numbers)
pain
# Print fpain (show as categorical names)
fpain
# Turn the categorizes into numbers 
as.numeric(fpain)-1
# Check the levels of a variable
levels(fpain)
# Internally, the 4-level factor above consists of 2 items 
# (a)a vector of integers between 1 and 4
# (b)a character vector of length 4 containing strings describing what the 4 levels are
```

### Building a list

Lists are the R objects which contain elements of different types like − numbers, strings, vectors and another list inside it. A list can also contain a matrix or a function as its elements. List is created using list() function.

```{r}
# Combine a collection of objects into a larger composite object. 
# Generate two vectors with Exam scores
exam1=c(50,60,72,92,83,89,58,81)             
exam2=c(60,71,84,94,95,90,77,87)
# Give names to the objects
# Build a list containing both exams
scores=list(midterm=exam1,final=exam2) 
# print the composite object
scores
# You can use "$" sign to extract the specific object in a list
# extract named components 
scores$final
```

### Building a Dataframe

```{r}
# Building a data frame using exam data we previously created
d=data.frame(exam1,exam2)
#the data are paired, the same student has a midterm and a final score
d     
# Use the "$" sign extract columns from a data frame 
d$exam1    
```

### Indexing (subsetting) Dataset

```{r}
# Select the 4th element in vector exam1
exam1[4] 
# The 1st,3rd,6th,7th element of "exam1"; alternatively
exam2[c(1,3,6,7)] 
# Build an indexing vector "v"
v=c(1,3,6,7)
# Select the indexing elements of "v" from data exam2
exam2[v]
# Select the first 6 elements
exam2[1:6]
# Select all the elements except the positions specified in v
exam2[-v]
# Conditional selection
exam2[exam1>=60]
# Select all the exam2 scores where exam 1's scores either less than 70, or larger than 90. 
exam2[exam1<70 |exam1>90] # "|"means "or"
# Select all the exam2 scores where exam 1's scores between 70 to 79.
exam2[exam1>=70 & exam1<80] # & means "and"
```

### More examples on indexing dataset

```{r}
# We will use the same data frame d.
d=data.frame(exam1,exam2)
# The element in the 5th row, 1st column
d[5,1]
# The vector in the 5th row
d[5,]        
d[d$exam1>90,]
# Conditional selection with logical outcome
lo=d$exam1>60 
lo
# Use a logical vector as the indexing vector
d[lo,]    
```

### Subset and transform data

```{r}
# Use the previous exam data set we created.
d
# Subset the dataset where the exam1 scores are larger than 60
d2=subset(d,exam1>60)
d2
# Adding a new column "exam1bonus" using transform function
d3=transform(d,exam1bonus=exam1+5)
d3
```

### Practice Questions

#### Question 1

subset Prestige dataset for subjects whose income is higher than 10,000 without using the "subset" function

#### Question 2

subset Prestige dataset for subjects whose income is higher than 10,000 with using the "subset" function

#### Question 3

subset Prestige dataset for subjects whose income is higher than 10,000 and who are professors without using the "subset" function



## Part 6: conditional statement

### if statement
`if` statement is used in evaluating a logical or mathematical expression and getting the desired output based on the specified criteria.

`if` Statement: use it to execute a block of code, if a specified condition is true

![Figure 1: The if Statement](if_statement.png)

![Figure 1: The if Statement flow chart](flowchart-simple.png)

```{r}
time=c(9.2,7,7.1,8.2,10.1,11,9.3,4.5,6.6,7.9,10.8,7.8,8.3)
status=c("pass","fail","fail","fail","fail","pass","fail","fail","pass","pass","fail","pass","fail")
# Combine two variables into data frame "rate"
rate=data.frame(time,status)
rate
# use the if function to check the first participant's pass/fail condition
if (rate[1,2]=="pass"){
  print("You are awesome!")
}
```

Another simple example:

```{r}
# Making a simple comparison
x <- 7
y <- 5
if(x > y) {
  print("x is greater")
}

```

Likewise, you can use following comparison operators to compare two values:

![Figure 2: Comparison Operators](comparison operators.png)
### Practice Questions

#### Question 1
Please write a if condition to evaluate whether the score of rate[3,2] is a "fail" or not, if the logical comparison is true, print out "work harder"


### More Example (Do not recommand)

In R, any non-zero value is considered `TRUE`, whereas a zero is considered `FALSE.` That’s why all the below if statements are valid.

```{r}

# any non-zero value
if(-3) {
  print("True")
}
```

`if` Statement Without Curly Braces: If you have only one statement to execute, you can skip curly braces.

```{r}
x <- 7
y <- 5
if(x > y) print("x is greater")
```

Nested if Statement: You can write one `if` statement inside another `if` statement to test more than one condition and return different results.

```{r}
x <- 7
y <- 5
z <- 2
if(x > y) {
  print("x is greater than y")
  if(x > z && x > y) print("x is greater than y and z")
}
```



### The `else` statement

Use `else` statement to execute a block of code, if the condition is false.

![Figure 3: if else statement syntax](if else statement.png)

![Figure 1: The if Statement flow chart](flowchart2.png)

A Simple if-else comparison:

```{r}
x <- 7
y <- 5
if(x > y) {
  print("x is greater than y")
} else {
  print("x is not greater than y")
}
```

```{r}
# use the if function to check the second participant's pass/fail condition
if (rate[2,2]=="pass"){
  print("You are awesome!")
  } else {
    print("Working harder")
          } 
```

### The `else if` statement

Use `else if` statement to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

The `else if` statement allows you to further customize your control structure. You can add as many `else` if statements as you like.

![Figure 4: else if statement syntax](else if syntax.png)

Using `else-if` statement

![Figure 1: The if Statement flow chart](flowchart.png)

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 5
if(x > y) {
  print("x is greater")
} else if(x < y) {
  print("y is greater")
} else {
  print("x and y are equal")
}
```

In R, you can use as many `else if` statements as you want in your program. There’s no limit. However, it’s not a best practice when you want to make series of decisions. You can use switch() function as an efficient way.

```{r}
# This time we check the participant's studying time from "rate" data.
# Check the first participant's studying time 
if(rate[1,1]<=7){
  print("Study More")
  } else if (rate[1,1]>7 & rate[1,1]<11){
    print("No pain No gain!")
  } else if (rate[1,1]>=11) {
      print("You are on fire！")
    }
```

### Practice Questions

#### Question 1
A school has following rules for grading system:
a. Below 25 - F
b. 25 to 45 - E
c. 45 to 50 - D
d. 50 to 60 - C
e. 60 to 80 - B
f. Above 80 - A

A student gets a score of 62, please print out the corresponding grade.


Multiple Conditions:

![True table ](Truetable.png)

To join two or more conditions into a single `if` statement, use logical operators viz. `&&` (and), `||` (or) and `!` (not). 

`&&` (and) expression is True, if all the conditions are true. 
![Figure 1: '&&' example](and-example.png)


```{r}
x <- 7
y <- 5
z <- 2
if(x > y && x > z) {
  print("x is greater")
}
```



`||` (or) expression is True, if at least one of the conditions is True.

![Figure 1: '&&' example](or-example.png)

```{r}
x <- 7
y <- 5
z <- 9
if(x > y || x > z) {
  print("x is greater than y or z")
}
```

`!` (not) expression is True, if the condition is false.

```{r}
x <- 7
y <- 5
if(!(x < y)) {
  print("x is greater")
}
```

#### Practice question
#### Question 1
Please write a 'if' condition to evaluate whether both scores of rate[1,2] and rate[2,2] are "fails" at the same time or not, if the joint logical comparison is false, print out "please help each other"


### One Line If…Else

If you have only one statement to execute, one for if , and one for else , you can put it all on the same line (The curly braces CAN BE OMITTED):

![Figure 5: One line if else syntax](one line if else.png)
Examples

```{r}
x <- 7
y <- 5
if (x > y) print("x is greater") else print("y is greater")
```

You can also use it to select variable assignment.

```{r}
x <- 7
y <- 5
max <- if (x > y) x else y
max
```

### The ifelse() Function

In R, conditional statements are NOT vector operations. They deal only with a single value.

If you pass in, for example, a vector, the `if` statement will only check the very first element and issue a warning.

```{r}
v <- c("apple","orrange","banana")
if(v =="orrange") {
  print("yes")
} else {
  print("no")
}
```

The solution to this is the `ifelse()` function. The `ifelse()` function checks the condition for every element of a vector and selects elements from the specified vector depending upon the result.

Here’s the syntax for the `ifelse()` function.

![Figure 6: if else function](if else function.png)

Example:

```{r}
v <- c("apple","orrange","banana")
ifelse(v =="orrange", "yes", "no")
```

#### Practice question
#### Question 1
Use ifelse to evaluate whether each score of rate[,2] is "fail" or not.




### R switch() function

The nested if…else statement is especially useful when you want to execute a certain block of code when a condition is met.

However, if you want to select values based only on a condition, you have a better option: Use the `switch()` function.

Here’s the syntax of the `switch()` function:

![Figure 7: Switch function Syntax](switch function.png)

`switch()` can work with String Expression

If the expression is a character string, `switch()` will return the value based on the name of the element.

```{r}
# Select element by name and return its value
x <- "a"
v <- switch(x, "a"="apple", "b"="banana", "c"="cherry")
v

x <- "c"
v <- switch(x, "a"="apple", "b"="banana", "c"="cherry")
v
```

In case of multiple matches, the value of first matching element is returned.

```{r}
# Select first match and return its value
x <- "a"
v <- switch(x, "a"="apple", "a"="apricot", "a"="avocado")
v
```


`switch()` with Numeric Expression

The numeric version of `switch()` works in a slightly different way. Instead of using names, the return value is determined purely with positional matching (Index).

```{r}
# Select element by position and return its value
x <- 1
v <- switch(x, "apple", "banana", "cherry")
v

x <- 3
v <- switch(x, "apple", "banana", "cherry")
v
```

If the numeric value is out of range (greater than the number of choices), `NULL` is returned.

```{r}
x <- 5
v <- switch(x, "apple", "banana", "cherry")
v
```

#### Practice question
#### Question 1
time=c(9.2,7,7.1,8.2,10.1,11,9.3,4.5,6.6,7.9,10.8,7.8,8.3)
Please check whether a student's responding time (9.5) is in the vector, "time".  




### Use "for" loop

The `for` statement in R is a bit different from what you usually use in other programming languages.

Rather than iterating over a numeric progression, R’s `for` statement can also iterate over the items of a vector or a list. The items are iterated in the order that they appear in the vector.


![Figure 8: For Loop Syntax](for loop syntax.png)
A for loop will run for as many times as you defined. 
Usually, we use 'i' as a variable to run over a 'range'. The range needs to be defined in the 'iterable' argment part. 
The 'iterable' part can be defined as a vector, a list of objects.  
What is inside of the '{}'? You could define items, function you would like to loop through. But, DO NOT FORGET to 'print out' the results.


Basic Examples, looping over the elements of a defined vector. 

```{r}
# Iterate through a vector
number <- c(1:10)
for (i in number) {
  print(i)
}
# 'i' is the variable will take the value from the defined looping range. The body will print out the value what I takes at each iteration 

colors <- c("red","green","blue","yellow")
for (i in colors) {
  print(i)
}
```

```{r}
# Iterate through a list
l <- list(3.14, "Hi", c(1,2,3))
for (i in l) {
  print(i)
}
```

If you need to execute a group of statements for a specified number of times, use sequence operator : or built-in function `seq()`
```{r}
# Print 'Hi!' 3 times
for (i in 1:3) {
  print("Hi!")
}

# Iterate a sequence and square each element
for (i in seq(from=2,to=8,by=2)) {
  print(i^2)
}
```

`for` Loop Without Curly Braces: If you have only one statement to execute, you can skip curly braces.

```{r}
# Print the numbers 0 to 4
for (x in 0:4) print(x)
```

#### Practice question
#### Question 1
time=c(9.2,7,7.1,8.2,10.1,11,9.3,4.5,6.6,7.9,10.8,7.8,8.3)
Loop through all the element of the vector "time", and print out square root of each element. 


Nested for loop:

A nested for loop is a loop within a loop. They are useful for when you want to repeat something several times for several things.
The order matters. Outside loop will be run first, then, moves to the inside loop. 

```{r}
for(x in 1:3) {
  for(y in 1:2) {
    print(paste(x, y))
  }
}
```

`Break` in for Loop: In R, `break` statement is used to exit the loop immediately. It simply jumps out of the loop altogether, and the program continues after the loop.

```{r}
# Break the loop at 'blue'
colors <- c("red","green","blue","yellow")
for (x in colors) {
  if (x == "blue")
    break  ##break means stop when the condition satifies 
  print(x)
}
```


```{r}
# Use the for loop to check whether each student passes the exam or not
time=c(9.2,7,7.1,8.2,10.1,11,9.3,4.5,6.6,7.9,10.8,7.8,8.3)
status=c("pass","fail","fail","fail","fail","pass","fail","fail","pass","pass","fail","pass","fail")
# Combine two variables into data frame "rate"
rate=data.frame(time,status)
rate
sample.size <- nrow(rate)
for (i in 1:sample.size) {
  if (rate[i,2]=="pass"){
  print("You are awesome!")
  } else {
    print("Working harder")
          } 
}
```

#### Practice question
#### Question 1

Use the for loop to check how much time they spent on studying. 
if a person spend less than or equal to 7 hours, print out "study more"; 
if a person spend more than 7 hours and less than 11 hours, print out "No pain, no gain";
if a person spend more than 11 hours, print out "You are on fire！".



### R Repeat Loop

A `repeat` loop just repeats a block of code indefinitely. In this loop, no condition checking is performed in order to end the loop.

To stop repeating the loop, you must put a condition explicitly inside it with break statement. Failing to do so will create an infinite/endless loop.

![Figure 9: Repeat function Syntax](repeat syntax.png)

Examples:

A repeat loop without a break statement results into an *infinite/endless* loop.

```{r}
# infinite loop
# repeat {
#  print("Press Esc to stop me!")
# }
```

However, you can put a condition explicitly inside the body of the loop and use the break statement to exit the loop.

```{r}
# Iterate until x becomes 5
x <- 1
repeat {
  x <- x + 1
  print(x)
  if (x > 4)
    break
}
```


## Part 7: R functions

### Make a function in R

In simple terms, a function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program. R provides many built-in functions and allows programmers to define their own functions.

Here’s the syntax of a function in R:

![Figure 10: Syntax of R function](R function syntax.png)
DO NOT FORGET to give a name to a defined function;
args are the INPUT elements
DO NOT FORGET to 'RETURN' the output

Create a Function: To define a function in R, use the `function` command and assign the results to a function name.

```{r}
# Create a function 'myfunc'
myfunc <- function() {
  print('Hello, World!')
}
```

If you have only one statement to execute, you can skip curly braces.

```{r}
# Write a function in one line
myfunc <- function() print('Hello, World!')
```

Call a Function: You can call (run) the function by adding parentheses after the function’s name.

```{r}
myfunc <- function() {
  print('Hello, World!')
}

myfunc()
```


Pass Arguments: You can send information to a function through arguments. Arguments are declared after the function keyword in parentheses.

You can send as many arguments as you like, just separate them by a comma`,`.

```{r}

sum <- function(x, y) {
  tot <- x + y
  return(tot)  #Return a Value: To return a value from a function, simply use a `return()` function.
}

#one bad example  If you do not include any `return()` function, it automatically returns the last expression. 

sum <- function(x, y) {
 x + y
}
sum(2, 3)
```

Named Arguments: If you pass arguments to a function by name, you can put those arguments in any order.

```{r}
pow <- function(x, y) {
  p <- x ^ y
  return(p) 
}

# using argument names
pow(x=2, y=3)

# changing the order
pow(y=3, x=2)
```

#### Practice question
#### Question 1
Write a function to multiply 3 numbers together; then, use the function you wrote to calculate 1*5*10


Return Multiple Values: You can return multiple values by saving the results in a vector (or a list) and returning it.

```{r}
math <- function(x, y) {
  add <- x + y
  sub <- x - y
  mul <- x * y
  div <- x / y
  res <- c(addition = add, subtraction = sub,
    multiplication = mul, division = div)
  return(res)
}

math(6, 3)
```


In R, it is often convenient to accept a variable number of arguments passed to the function. To do this, you specify an ellipsis `(...)` in the arguments when defining a function.

For example, below function directly use the arguments from the `summary()`and 'plot()' function as the inputs of the function you create.

```{r}
myfunc <- function(...) {
  a <- summary(...)
  b <- plot(...)
  return(a)
  return(b)
  }
v <- 1:10

myfunc(v)
```



## Part 8: Splitting data & implicit loops

### Splitting the data

```{r}
# Type in the data set with two variables "time" and "status"
# Time means study hours that students spent on studying
# Status is an indicator showing whether a candidate pass or fail the exam
time=c(9.2,7,7.1,8.2,10.1,11,9.3,4.5,6.6,7.9,10.8,7.8,8.3)
status=c("pass","fail","fail","fail","fail","pass","fail","fail","pass","pass","fail","pass","fail")
# Combine two variables into data frame "rate"
rate=data.frame(time,status)
# filter out how much time do participants spent when they passed the exams. 
sta.pass=rate$time[rate$status=="pass"] 
sta.pass
### ? what is the meaning of this line 
sta.fail=rate$time[rate$status=="fail"]
sta.fail
```

### Function "apply"

```{r}
# Use ?+function name to check the help document of certain function
?matrix
# Use function "matrix" and "rnorm" to build a random function
m=matrix(rnorm(12),nrow =4)
m
# Select the minimum value column wise 
apply(m,2,min) 
# the second argument: 1 is set to "row", 2 is set to "column"
# the function min() is applied to each column 
# Select the minimum value row wise 
apply(m,1,min) 
```

#### Practice 

Use apply() function to calculate the mean of values in each column of the matrix: m. 


Use apply() function to calculate the mean of values in each row of the matrix: m. 



### Use function "lapply"

The function lapply() applies over a list or a vector

```{r}
# Build a list
x <- list(a = 1:10, beta = exp(-3:3))
# Compute the list mean for each list element
lapply(x,mean)
# Quantiles for each list element 0.25 0.50 0.75
lapply(x, quantile, probs = c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75)) 
```
