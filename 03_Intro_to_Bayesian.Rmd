# Introduction to Bayesian Inference {#Bayes_Inf}

## Install the JAGS for R

### Install JAGS

The following are the steps to install the Bayesian sampling program JAGS.

- Go to website http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net for instructions. To download the JAGS installation program (JAGS –x.x.x.exe), visit the webpage https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files.

![Figure 1. Install the JAGS](download Jags.png)

- Run the JAGS installation program to install JAGS. When asked to Choose Install
Location, select the folder created earlier, e.g. C:\\Bayesian\\JAGS-4.2.0, and follow the installation instructions. If you are a mac user, then don't worry about the file location.

### Install Package rjags

The following are the steps to install R package rjags (to let R talk to JAGS). There are two ways to do this:

In the RStudio menu bar at the top of the screen, select Tools→Install Packages, then type rjags under Packages.

- Or you can in the R Studio console window, type `install.packages("rjags")`

## Bernoulli and Binomial Distributions in JAGS

### Set the working directory

To run this file, we create a folder called 'Bernoulli and Binomial'. Currently, the code assumes this is in the C drive as C:\\Bayes Course\\Analyses\\Bernoulli and Binomial\\ 

Inside the 'Bernoulli and Binomial' folder, create a subfolder called 'R'. Currently, the code assumes this is in the C drive as C:\\Bayes Course\\Analyses\\Bernoulli and Binomial\\R\\ . We store this file in the 'R' folder.

The following is the R code demonstrating a Bayesian analysis using R and JAGS.

```{r}
# Remove objects from memory
rm(list=ls())
# Define folders with locations
# Here is where you can change the location of the "main folder" 
main.folder <- "Bayes Course/Analyses/Bernoulli and Binomial/"
R.folder <- paste0(main.folder, "R/")
jags.folder <- paste0(main.folder, "jags/")
dir.create(jags.folder)
# Call the packages
library(rjags)
```


### Define the Model and Write out the code

```{r}
# Define the model in JAGS code
modelstring <- as.character("
model{
theta <- .7
x ~ dbern(theta)
y ~ dbin(theta, J)
} # closes the model
") # closes the model as string
# Write out the code to a file
model.file.name <- "Bernoulli and Binomial Distributions.txt"
write(x=modelstring, file=paste0(jags.folder, model.file.name), append=FALSE)
```

### Model Specification

```{r}
# Define data used in the model
J=10  # number of trials in the binomial model
# Arrange the data to supply to JAGS
jags.data <- list("J"=J)
# Define entities to monitor
entities.to.monitor <- c("x", "y")
# Choose features of MCMC
#	The number of iterations 
n.iters = 10
# Run MCMC
#	Move to the JAGS folder
setwd(jags.folder)
# Initialize the model
jags.model.initialized <- jags.model(file=model.file.name,
                                     data=jags.data)
```


### Model Results

```{r}
# Now obtain the distribution
jags.model.fitted <- coda.samples(
  model=jags.model.initialized,
  variable.names=entities.to.monitor,
  n.iter=n.iters,
  progress.bar="gui")
# Plot the results
plot(jags.model.fitted, smooth = FALSE)
# Numerically summarize the results
summary(jags.model.fitted)
```

## Beta Distribution in JAGS

### Set the working directory

To run this file, we create a folder called 'Bernoulli and Binomial'. Currently, the code assumes this is in the C drive as C:\\Bayes Course\\Analyses\\Bernoulli and Binomial\\ 

Inside the 'Bernoulli and Binomial' folder, create a subfolder called 'R'. Currently, the code assumes this is in the C drive as C:\\Bayes Course\\Analyses\\Bernoulli and Binomial\\R\\ . We store this file in the 'R' folder.

The following is the R code demonstrating a Bayesian analysis using R and JAGS.

```{r}
# Define folders with locations
# Here is where you can change the location of the "main folder" 
main.folder <- "Bayes Course/Analyses/Bernoulli and Binomial/"
R.folder <- paste0(main.folder, "R/")
jags.folder <- paste0(main.folder, "jags")
dir.create(jags.folder)
# Call the packages
library(rjags)
```

### Define the Model and Write out the code

```{r}
# Define the model in JAGS code
modelstring <- as.character("
model{
x[1] ~ dbeta(1,1)
x[2] ~ dbeta(5,5)
x[3] ~ dbeta(5,17)
x[4] ~ dbeta(.5, .5)
} # closes the model
") # closes the model as string
# Write out the code to a file
model.file.name <- "Beta Distributions.txt"
write(x=modelstring, file=paste0(jags.folder, model.file.name), append=FALSE)
```

### Model Specification

```{r}
# Define entities to monitor
entities.to.monitor <- c("x")
# Choose features of MCMC
#	  the total number of iterations 
n.iters = 40000
# Run MCMC
#	Move to the JAGS folder
# setwd(jags.folder)
# Initialize the model
# jags.model.fitted <- jags.model(file=model.file.name)
```
